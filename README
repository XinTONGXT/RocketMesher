This README file contains instructions on how to use the
script mesher.py in conjunction with salome

-- Preparing the script
in mesher.py, add or remove rocket sections using commands like

rocket.addSection(<sectionName>(<sectionParameters>))

-- Running the script
When done, launch salome from a terminal. It is _essential_ that salome be run
from the directory of mesher.py, otherwise salome's interpreter won't find the
other source files.

The command to launch salome could be similar to
~$ /path/to/salome/appli_V7_3_0/runAppli

Once salome is running, select file->new, then select "Geometry" from the
dropdown menu where "SALOME" is displayed and then do file->load script and
select mesher.py.
In salome's interpreter, in the lower part of the window, an "execfile" command
appears. Any error in the execution of mesher.py is displayed in that
interpreter.

-- Visualization
If execution terminated normally, Expand item "Geometry" in the object browser
[left column] and press F5 to update the tree.
A "rocket" object appears and you can make it visible by toggling the eye icon.

You can observe the result in the viewer.
Right-click the surface and choose display mode->shading for a better 3D
rendering.
Click the mouse-like icon in the viewer toolbar to enable 3D rotation of the
generated surface.
